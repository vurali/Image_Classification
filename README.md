# Image Classification on MNIST Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to accurately classify these images into their respective digit classes.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image, meaning it has one channel with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are particularly effective for image classification tasks as they can automatically learn hierarchical features from the images.

### Layers:
1. **Input Layer**: The input layer receives the 28x28 pixel images.
2. **Convolutional Layers**: These layers consist of convolutional filters that extract features from the input images. Each convolutional layer is typically followed by a non-linear activation function like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).
3. **Pooling Layers**: Pooling layers downsample the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers, reducing the spatial dimensions and controlling overfitting.
4. **Flatten Layer**: The flatten layer converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector, which can be fed into the dense layers.
5. **Dense Layers**: These fully connected layers process the flattened features to make predictions. The last dense layer usually has 10 neurons (one for each digit class) and softmax activation for multi-class classification.

## Training
The model is trained using the training images and corresponding labels. During training, the model adjusts its parameters (weights and biases) to minimize a chosen loss function, typically categorical cross-entropy. The optimization algorithm used is typically stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants like Adam.

## Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using the testing images and labels to assess its performance on unseen data. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Performance
The performance of the model is influenced by various factors including the architecture of the CNN, hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size, and preprocessing techniques like normalization. Tuning these factors is essential to achieve the best possible performance.

## Results
The results of the image classification task typically include the accuracy of the model on the testing dataset and, optionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices to understand the model's behavior in more detail.

## Conclusion
Image classification on the MNIST dataset is a fundamental task in computer vision and machine learning. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in accurately classifying handwritten digits and serves as a foundation for more complex image recognition tasks.
